# hello-world
This is my first GitHub repository, I have no idea what I'm doing!

My name is Jenn, I am learning coding and GitHub for my job as a nutrition researcher.
I have a Master's degree in nutrition & health promotion and I'm also a Registered Dietitian (RD).
Some people think RDs are the food police or that all we do is push supplements in the hospital.
To me an RD is someone who loves food and wants everyone to appreciate food and what it can do for our health.
I love pizza and ice cream but I also love veggies and fish.  Balance is key!
